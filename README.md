# Data-Driven Storytelling with Power BI and Tableau: Dairy Business Simulation Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves creating two data-driven stories using Power BI and Tableau based on a dairy business simulation dataset. The goal is to analyze the performance of an assigned dairy company and provide actionable insights for future management decisions.

## Dataset

The data comes from a dairy business simulation. It includes eight rounds of simulation and covers various aspects of dairy business operations such as:
- Inventory management
- Pricing strategies
- Sales performance
- Distribution across regional warehouses
- Company valuation

## Project Objectives

1. Create two different stories, each with at least five story points.
2. Develop one story using Power BI and another using Tableau.
3. Analyze the data from the perspective of a single assigned dairy company.
4. Provide specific recommendations for future actions based on the analysis.

## Key Business Aspects

- Product distribution from main warehouse to regional warehouses
- Inventory management across different storage locations
- Pricing strategies and their impact on sales and profitability
- Stock replenishment from a dairy cooperative
- Balancing prices with unit costs and administrative expenses

## Tools Used

- Power BI
- Tableau
- DAX Studio

## Key Features-

### Power BI Story
- Utilizes bookmarks, focus mode, and spotlight features.
- Incorporates visualization principles and visual hierarchy.
- Includes annotations and highlights to focus on important findings.

### Tableau Story
- Uses Tableau's story functionality.
- Limited to two visualizations per story point.
- Applies appropriate charts and visualization techniques.

## Project Structure

1. Data exploration and analysis in Power BI
2. Story development in Power BI
3. Data export and preparation for Tableau
4. Story development in Tableau
5. Verification of Tableau calculations using Power BI
6. Documentation of insights and recommendations

## Deliverables

1. Power BI file containing the first story
2. Tableau file containing the second story
3. Word document discussing the pros and cons of storytelling using Tableau versus Power BI

## Evaluation Criteria

- Adherence to visualization principles and visual hierarchy
- Effectiveness of storytelling and insight communication
- Appropriateness of chart selection
- Clarity and specificity of recommendations for dairy business management
- Accuracy of calculations and data representation

This project was completed as part of a course assignment focusing on data visualization and storytelling techniques using popular business intelligence tools, applied to a dairy business simulation scenario.
